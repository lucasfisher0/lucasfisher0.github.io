Hello, my name is Lucas and this website is for sharing various tips and tricks about my hobbies.

I enjoy going down rabbit-holes to learn more about specific topics; sometimes I'm able to help
with some examples of my existing code.

I love helping other people achieve, so I've finally got around to making this website to catalog
some tutorials and personal projects in one spot.
